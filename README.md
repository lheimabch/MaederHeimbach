# Final Project PDE on GPUs

## Description
This repository simulates and presents the behavior of the Maxwell equation in different settings. Namely the linear lossy problem and the $\chi^3$ nonlinear lossy problem with perfect conductor and perfect absorbing boundary conditions. The linear lossy problem was simulated both in 2D and 3D, whereas the $\chi^3$ nonlinear lossy problem was simulated solely in 3D.
